1. DISTRIBUTION: This program is meant for Android: the official
Android Market or other official distributing systems they might 
come up with. However, if you want, you can distribute it on
another (personal or whatever) site if you credit me with at
least a visible link to either one of these web pages:
http://teodorfilimon.com
http://teodorfilimon.com/android/Tag-ToDo-List/index.html

2. CHANGE: You aren't allowed to decompile this program, change
it and then redistribute it on your own. Changes will be made in
an organized way within the open-source project:
http://code.google.com/p/tag-todo-list/
The open-source project is currently idle and will be started
during the first year of usage after some initial (usage :)
feedback will be received. The products of the project
(consisting only of elements provided within the project) will
respect the New BSD License. More info to come in 2009, on the
Google Code project page :)
 
3. RESOURCES (mainly icons - can be found in the 'res/drawable'
folder as .png files):
	- the 'icon.png' image has been designed by www.ganato.com;
	you can't use it for any app or web page, sorry :S
	- the other icons (from the 'drawable' folder) have been
	purchased under license from www.techlogica.us
All the icons can only be used for the original app.

4. USAGE: This app is provided as is, with no warranty of any
kind. If you find any bugs or have suggestions, you can help
a lot by sending a message from the Tag ToDo List web site:
http://teodorfilimon.com/android/Tag-ToDo-List/index.html
The app's website has the same terms of use as the mother site:
http://teodorfilimon.com

5. RELEASE LOG: 
http://tagtodolist.blogspot.com/
This is a release log of Tag-ToDo-List. It will tell you what's
new in each version, starting with the latest version.

6. STEPS TO COMPILE A RELEASE:
- copy strings.xml from values-en to values
- increase version code and version name
- increase database version (necessary to circumvent alarm
removal by Android on app update)
- export signed package
