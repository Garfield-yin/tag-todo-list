#summary Compiling an .APK file
#labels Phase-Deploy

I'll be the one adding the existing app signature to the .APK file and uploading it to the Android Market, as part of the 'official project'. I'll do this once in a while - when i do it, i'll also post a new download with the corresponding .APK. However, you're welcome to make unsigned .APK files for testing purposes between the members of this project.
